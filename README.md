# PROJECT-BC2407-Advanced-Predictive-Techniques

Hello! We are Sem 3 Team 2 taught by Prof Eric Kwon! Our Project Title is Carity, and we hope to use analytics to bring clarity to Healthcare in Africa!

## So what is the problem?

**The Business Problem** lies in inaccurate assessment of Length of Stay (LOS) in South African Hospitals.

Doctors are at the forefront of a hospital's operations, yet their scope of decisions arguably fail to include the wide range of administrative constraints faced by the hospital in its entirety. This leads to even wider implications like Patient Health Risks, Poor Patient Experience, Higher Healthcare Charges, Operational Delay and Inefficiency, and Increased Financial Burden on the hospital.

HealthMan is a privately owned healthcare consultancy specialising in the management and administration of hospitals in South Africa. Their mission is to promote the professional and commercial interests of hospitals. To solve the above problem, we as interns at HealthMan have come up with a two-pronged approach using Analytics at its core.

## Overview of Business Problem and Approach

## Target Outcome 1 - Consistent and Accurate Presciption of LOS

This approach uses **Machine Learning** Models to help doctors predict LOS by providing a benchmark value based on a wide range of hospital data.

The models trialled were Multi-Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Random Forest. For more details, please refer to our Python Notebook!

Based on the most **accurate, explainable, and easy to implement** model, we embed our predictions in a Hospital's EMR System for doctors to refer to in real-time during consultations.

Lastly, the **Integrated Hospital Management Dashboard** serves to supplement doctor's decisions by providing a non-technical, high-level overview of the hospital situation.

## Target Outcome 2 - Targeting Unnecessary LOS

To further help hospitals customise a solution for improving LOS, we use Variable Importance to identify the most significant factors influencing LOS. Feature Importance can be generated from CART and Random Forest. This data is then taken in by our Interactive Dashboard and transformed into visually-appealing data stories.
